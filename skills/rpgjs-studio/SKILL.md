description: Use the RPGJS Studio HTTP API to create or manage a 2D RPG game. Trigger this skill when Codex needs to CRUD maps, map events, database records, media assets, or general project settings in RPGJS Studio, especially when the task should be done through `curl` or another HTTP client with an API key and configurable base URL.

# RPGJS Studio API Skill

Use this skill to execute content-management tasks against an RPGJS Studio instance.

## Inputs

- Check whether a local `RPGSTUDIO.md` file exists in the current working directory.
- If `RPGSTUDIO.md` exists, treat it as local project context and read it first.
- Use it to recover persistent values such as:
  - `BASE_URL`
  - any other project-specific instructions relevant to API usage
- Do not recover, request, or persist a `projectId`. The API key is scoped to the RPGJS Studio project, so work directly on the user's requested resource.
- If `RPGSTUDIO.md` does not exist, continue normally.
- Resolve `BASE_URL` from the user if provided.
- Default `BASE_URL` to `https://rpgjs.studio` when the user did not specify another host.
- Read the API key from the environment variable `RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY`.

## Mandatory startup workflow

1. Check whether `RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY` exists before any API call.
2. When checking `RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY`, never print its value in the terminal and never echo it back in the response.
3. If the variable is missing or empty, stop and tell the user to create an API key first on `${BASE_URL}/api-keys`, then export `RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY`.
4. Build authenticated requests with these headers:

```bash
-H "x-api-key:$RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

5. Prefer `curl` for HTTP calls. Use another HTTP client only if there is a clear reason.
6. Fail fast on authentication errors. If the API returns an invalid-key style response, `401`, or `403`, stop the task and tell the user to verify the key or contact support.
7. Read only the reference file that matches the user task:
   - `references/database.md`
   - `references/maps.md`
   - `references/events.md`
   - `references/event-examples.md`
   - `references/blocks.md`
   - `references/media.md`
   - `references/settings.md`

## Local memory file

Use `RPGSTUDIO.md` as a lightweight local memory file for the current project.

- Read it at the start if it exists.
- Reuse values already stored there instead of asking again.
- After the task, update or create it with stable, non-secret context discovered during execution.

Typical contents:

- last used `BASE_URL`
- project-specific conventions or notes useful for future calls

Do not use `RPGSTUDIO.md` to select a project. The current `RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY` already identifies the target project, so proceed directly with the user's request.

Never store secrets in this file.

- Do not store `RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY`.
- Do not print `RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY`.
- Do not copy raw secret values into logs, terminal output, or markdown.

## Request pattern

Define the base command once and reuse it:

```bash
BASE_URL="${BASE_URL:-https://rpgjs.studio}"
curl -sS \
  -H "x-api-key:$RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

For write operations, prefer:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$BASE_URL/..." \
  -H "x-api-key:$RPGSTUDIO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{...}'
```

## Execution rules

- Start by identifying the resource domain, then load the matching reference file.
- Use REST semantics: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
- Resolve foreign keys before creation or update:
  - Search media with `/api/media?query=<search>`.
  - Search database records with `/api/database/:type?query=<search>`.
  - If a matching dependency exists, reuse its returned `_id`.
  - If not found, create it first, then continue with the returned `_id`.
- Never call a project listing endpoint just to choose a project. The API key determines the project context.
- When the user asks to create game objects, send the smallest valid payload first, then enrich it only if the task requires more fields.
- Reuse IDs returned by the API instead of guessing them.
- When the user provides a database `_id` for a read, update, or delete task, call `GET /api/database/:type/:id` first and inspect the existing record before deciding the payload or reporting the content.
- If an endpoint shape is uncertain, inspect the response from a nearby `GET` endpoint first and adapt from that live payload.
- Do not continue after an auth failure.
- If a missing dependency would require AI media generation, always call the unified media generation endpoint with `action: "estimate"` first.
- After the estimate, report the required credits to the user and ask for confirmation before calling `action: "execute"`.
- Never start an AI media generation directly without this estimate and confirmation step.
- For `POST /api/maps/generate`, rely on `references/maps.md` for the AI map generation workflow and endpoint-specific failure behavior.
- Summarize the exact records created, updated, or deleted in the final response.
- When a task reveals stable project context such as `BASE_URL` or local conventions, persist that non-secret context into `RPGSTUDIO.md` for future runs.

## Common checks

- `database` task: read [references/database.md](./references/database.md)
- `map` task: read [references/maps.md](./references/maps.md)
- `event` task: read [references/events.md](./references/events.md)
- `event example` task: read [references/event-examples.md](./references/event-examples.md)
- `event workflow block` task: read [references/blocks.md](./references/blocks.md)
- `media` task: read [references/media.md](./references/media.md)
- `settings` task: read [references/settings.md](./references/settings.md)

## Current schema notes

- Project settings and database enemies both support combat animation spritesheet media IDs under `animations`: `attack`, `hurt`, `die`, and `castSpell`.
- The RPGJS starter runtime uses these spritesheets in action battle: attack actions, damage/hurt feedback, delayed death removal, and skill/cast usage can temporarily switch to the configured spritesheet.
- Database enemies support action battle AI options under `behavior`: `enemyType`, `attackCooldown`, `visionRange`, `attackRange`, `dodgeChance`, `dodgeCooldown`, `fleeThreshold`, `attackPatterns`, `patrolWaypoints`, and `groupBehavior`.
- Project settings and database enemies both support level-gated skill acquisition under `skills`: `{ skillId, level }`.
- Database skills support media IDs under `icon`, `animation`, and `sound`.
